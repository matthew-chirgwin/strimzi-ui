# config

This module is responsible for serving the current configuration to the client on request. It does this by providing a GraphQL endpoint `/config` which exposes ['all non sensitive'](../../config/README.md#configuration-sensitivity) configuration from the [`config` directory](../../config). The schema is dynamically generated by [`json-to-simple-graphql-schema`](https://github.com/walmartlabs/json-to-simple-graphql-schema).
