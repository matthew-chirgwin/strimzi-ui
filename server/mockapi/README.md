# mockapi

This module is used at development and test time to emulate a real instance of `Strimzi-admin`. It will return mock data as if a real instance of `Strimzi-admin` had responded, and also offer additional mutations to trigger responses needed in particular scenarios (eg user not authorised to perform an action etc).

_Note_: Implementation of config/response change to be delivered in a later PR
